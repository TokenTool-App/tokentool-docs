# Generating contract address of the smart number

How to generate a smart contract address, for example: ``0x0000000000004946c0e9f43f4dee607b0ef1fa1c``.
Check the following steps to learn how to use the PC terminal to generate a smart number contract address through the contract smart number generator of the TokenTool platform.

1. Open [VanityContractGenerator](https://tokentool.app/other/vanityContractGenerator) address: [https://tokentool.app/other/vanityContractGenerator](https://tokentool.app/other/vanityContractGenerator)

2. Enter the string content of the name you want to generate ** (reminder: after the page is loaded, it is recommended to disconnect the network or turn off WI-FI offline generation) **

3. As shown in the figure above, the contract address with the suffix tail number 8888 is generated and 4 threads are used.

4. According to your computer configuration, adjust the number of threads. The generation speed depends on the number of core threads of your computer CPU. For example, the more threads, the faster the generation.

5. After success, you can see: **contract address**, **address**, **private key**, using this address to deploy the contract for the first time will get a smart contract address.

Import the wallet address, and transfer enough to pay the commission for deploying the coin issuance contract. Now you can deploy the contract through the one-click coin issuance function.

**Reminder: After deploying the contract with this address, you can immediately transfer the ownership of the contract to the large address and add the large address to the whitelist. **

**Use this address at the same time to issue tokens on different chains for the first time, and you will get the same contract address. **

**For example, after I issued coins on the BSC chain, I got: `0x0000000000004946c0e9f43f4dee607b0ef1fa1c` address. **

**Similarly, I will get the same address when I issue tokens for the first time on the ETH chain, and other chains are similar. **
