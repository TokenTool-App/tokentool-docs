#tokentool.app Scientist Grabbing Coin Artifact

Since shib became popular, various animal coins have appeared in the primary market, and they have also begun to move to the primary market. The primary market is always several times, tens of times or even hundreds of times, which is very exciting. However, the coins in the primary market have not passed the review, and the risks are extremely high. But to play the primary market to grab new coins, you need a good tool-coin grabbing scientist. Grab in the project as soon as it opens, and earn a large profit in the later stage.

## **What is TokenTool.App? **

TokenTool.app itself is a website for scientists with many powerful functions, such as creating wallets in batches, airdropping in batches, querying in batches, token collection, wallet authorization release and other powerful functions. Of course, what I want to introduce today is not these, but an artifact for scientists to grab coins designed for the hot primary market. Best of all ** FREE! ** **free! ** **free! ** A little server and labor fee may be charged later, but it is always free now.

When choosing a platform, I found that this scientist coin grabbing artifact supports many platforms, basically the mainstream ones seen in the market are all supported, and recently, other platforms such as quickswap of the horseshoe chain have been added.

Everyone chooses the corresponding platform according to the dex of the currency they want to grab. Here is a demonstration. I chose the Rinkeby test network of the eth chain, and chose the uniswap platform to demonstrate how to snap up.

After choosing a platform, import the private key. It is strongly recommended to use a small wallet with small assets to grab coins. The private key is needed to save the confirmation operation and directly realize fast automatic trading. **This program runs completely locally and will not upload the private key To the server, welcome to monitor and inspect.**

After the private key is successfully loaded, the user can see the balance of BNB or HT or OKT, and which one is displayed depends on which smart chain the trading platform selected by the user belongs to.

Currently supports users to buy and sell, two-way trading

Transaction currency: use platform currency or USDT stable currency for purchase

Contract address: it is the currency that can be traded in uniswap. This tutorial demonstrates the purchase of UNI test currency, the address `0xb1d1502fa0e5791c655b8e62e189335a25ebc8d4`

Advance authorization: In general, if there is no currency in the wallet, it cannot be authorized in advance. Scientists can authorize coins that are not available in advance, and there is no need to authorize again when selling. Sell faster and avoid missing the best selling point.

Flow pool: The flow pool detects the current currency transaction pair, which configuration is used, such as UNI-ETH, then choose ETH, and the transaction pairs of different currencies are different. If you don’t know what the transaction pair is, choose the autoCheck automatic detection mechanism .

Minimum number of liquidity pools: Check the number of trading pairs in the liquidity pool. If it is less than the configuration information, the order will not be placed, and it will not be checked by default.

Purchase amount/quantity: For example, if you set the purchase amount to 2 ETH and the number of purchases to 5 times, the scientist will automatically purchase 2 ETH continuously for 5 times, for a total of 10 ETH

Retry on failure: Check whether the purchase is successful after the purchase. If it fails, the purchase will continue until the purchase is successful. This switch will always burn fees, so be careful.

Advanced function: automatic selling smart return (this function calculates the average price based on the purchased currency and the spent currency, and calculates the increase in the price of the currently purchased currency in real time. If it exceeds the increase ratio, it will sell the ratio.

The token administrator will turn on the suspension of transactions, and the transaction will not be able to be turned on. By turning on the failure retry function, the order will be placed in a loop until it succeeds.

In the transaction here, you can see that you bought 0.01ETH, bought 5 times, and spent a total of UNI coins. The calculated average price is 0.010425074494342828.

The price of UNI was raised through another wallet address, and 0.0223484 ETH was bought. At this time, the price of UNI rose to 0.0113767, which triggered the smart return function and sold 2.398064398826719304 UNI.
